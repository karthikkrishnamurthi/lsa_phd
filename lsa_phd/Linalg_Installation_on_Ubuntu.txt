1. Install liblapack-dev and libblas-dev using apt-get (do some googling)
         sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev libblas-dev
2. Download ruby-1.9 binaries:
         linalg-1.0.1-i686-darwin9-ruby19.tgz
   from http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=273
2. Extract the above folder and do:
         sudo ruby install.rb
   from within that folder
3. When you get "checking for g2c.h... no A full LAPACK installation was not found." error
   then The solution that worked for me.
   1. Download g77-intel-bin from:
      http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hpc/g77-intel-bin.tar.gz?download
      and extract it (it gets extracted with the folder name "usr")
   2a. Copy usr/local/lib/libg2c.a to /usr/local/lib
   2b. Copy usr/local/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin8.8.1/3.4.0/include/g2c.h to /usr/local/include/
   3. Then "sudo ruby install.rb" for linalg-1.0.0.tgz worked like a charm!
